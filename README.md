## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Looking at all the theatre data, May was the month with the most successful campaigns launched at 67% with June being a close second at 65%. December was the worst month for successful campaigns at 49%

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Looking at all the play data, plays with a goal of under $5,000 had a 73% success rate. Plays with a goal of $5,000 - $25,000 had a success rate of 54%. Plays with a goal over $25,000 had a success rate of 32%.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

In the outcomes based on launch date chart, we included all theater data in the dataset not just plays. Also we included world wide results, not just US results. In looking at the raw data, I see we included a bunch of failed campaigns that had pledges of less than $10. This may have skewed the results. We might should have removed them as outliers.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


We could also have included a chart showing the number of backers and the amount of pledges for successful campaigns.
